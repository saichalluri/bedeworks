SUMMARY: Improvisation in the Arts: A Symposium                                

DESCRIPTION: Romare Bearden constantly made the color he constantly looked for.    
 His collages mirrored and enacted what critic Laura Harris calls the  
 aesthetics of black social life, moving against the brutalities of    
 removal and enclosure that structure global black experience and,     
 therefore, the modern world. A Black Odyssey refers, though, not only 
 to Afro-diasporic travel and travail but also to an anoriginary       
 movement of in the art of the West that blackness has                 
 come to signifythe polyrhythmic, oral-formulaic, insurgent innovation 
 that was also Homers home away from home.In this panel,               
 a multi-disciplinary group of artists and scholars will sit in with   
 Bearden, gathering with and around his Odyssean practice,             
 his restless, wandering devotion to the scrap, the fragment, the      
 musical moment, and his abiding in and with the imagination, whose    
 enduring philosophical racialization renders it both disposable and   
 appropriable. The intensity of Beardens commitment to the aesthetic   
 contact and content of black social life in its broadest dimensions   
 will serve as an impetus for a wide-ranging discussion                
 of the protocols and implications of improvisation in music,          
 literature, theology, cinema, dance and critical theory. Along with   
 Bearden and, most importantly, the audience, the panel hopes to form  
 a new experimental band. Program ParticipantsFred Moten is author of  
 In the Break The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition, Hughsons  
 Tavern, B. Jenkins, The Undercommons Fugitive Planning and Black      
 Study (with Stefano Harney), The Feel Trio and The Little Edges.      
 Moten lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the University of           
 California, Riverside. John Akomfrah OBE, is a seminal figure in      
 Black British Cinema and forerunner in digital cinematography. He has 
 a body of work that is considered one of the most distinctive and     
 innovative in contemporary Britain. Born in Ghana, to politically     
 active parents he moved to London at an early age. He was a founding  
 figure in the influential cine cultural group Black Audio Film        
 Collective which was dedicated to exploring questions of Black        
 British identity, race and class through film and media. In 1999, he  
 set up Smoking Dogs Films - which simultaneously cohabits the worlds  
 of broadcast, cinema and the arts - with his long term producing      
 partners, David Lawson and Lina Gopaul. John has served on numerous   
 boards as a governor, including the British Film Institute and Film   
 London and has taught at a number of institutions around the world    
 including MIT, Yale and the University of Westminster. John Akomfrah  
 is a director, writer and theorist who creates documentaries, feature 
 films and exhibitions that have garnered international critical       
 acclaim. J. Kameron Carternbsp is a professor and teaches courses in  
 both theology and black church studies. Working as a theologian, he   
 addresses the basic areas of Christian thought, especially attending  
 to Christology (the person and work of Jesus Christ) and theological  
 anthropology (the human being in Christian perspective). But in       
 engaging such matters, he does so with a view not just to the church  
 or to Christian believers. He does so with a view to the broader      
 humanities, particularly, with an eye toward such fields as cultural  
 studies, gender studies, and philosophy and literature. His book Race 
 A Theological Account (New York Oxford University Press, 2008) has    
 recently appeared. He is presently working on a new book on the       
 ideological uses of Jesus in the modern invention of the human, and   
 thus in the making and sustaining of the present. Addressing this in  
 its religious, secular, and now arguably post-secular forms,          
 Professor Carter calls this the problem of the cultural Jesus. The    
 project provides a theological, which at the same time is a cultural, 
 archaeology of the present by getting inside of this problem. But     
 beyond this, and having gotten inside of this problem, Professor      
 Carter reimagines the identity of Jesus and the politics of his       
 identity in light of the new, global realities of the 21st century.   
 Danielle Goldman In her research, she analyzes the social, cultural,  
 and historical conditions that affect how people move.                
 She is fascinated by critical theories of the body, andnbsp tendd to  
 think about dance as an arena for experimental relations between self 
 and other. These interests are informed by her experience as a dancer 
  taking class, rehearsing, and performing (most recently for the      
 choreographers DD Dorvillier and Beth Gill). Persistent shuttling     
 between dance practice and academic work  two worlds that she has     
 been trying to bridge for as long as she can remember  has shown her  
 that dance and critical theory inform each other in significant ways, 
 revealing much about embodiment, subjectivity, and notions            
 of identity. M. NourbeSe Philips is an unembedded poet, essayist,     
 novelist and playwright who lives in the space-time of the City of    
 Toronto. She practiced law in the City of Toronto for seven years     
 before becoming a poet and writer. She has published four books of    
 poetry including the seminal She Tries Her Tongue Her Silence Softly  
 Breaks, one novel and three collections of essays. Her most recent    
 work is the conceptually innovative, book-length poem Zong!, which    
 explodes the legal archive as it relates to slavery. Among her awards 
 are numerous Canada Council and Ontario Arts Council grants, as well  
 as the Pushcart Prize (USA, 1981), the Casa de las Americas Prize     
 (Cuba, 1988), the Lawrence Foundation Prize (USA, 1994), and the Arts 
 Foundation of Toronto Writing and Publishing Award                    
 (Toronto,1995),nbsp Dora Award finalist (1999). Her fellowships       
 include Guggenheim (1990), McDowell (1991), and Rockefeller           
 (Bellagio) (2005). She has been Writer-in-Residence at several        
 universities. Matana Robertsnbsp internationally documented and

 instrument is the alto saxophone and she works in many                
 performance/sound mediums including improvisation, dance, poetry, and 
 theater. She aims to expose the mystical roots and the intuitive      
 spirit-raising traditions of American creative expression in her      
 music. Her innovative work has forged new conceptual approaches to    
 considering narrative, history, and political expression within       
 improvisatory structures. Past member of the BRC Black Rock Coalition 
 and the AACM Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.

SUMMARY: The Case Of China: How Migration Shapes Political Attitudes and       
 Participation in Origin Communities                                   

DESCRIPTION: This presentation examines the consequences of migration for          
 political transformation in origin communities in China. Lu broadens  
 previous scholarly focus on the transnational activism of politically 
 conscious migrants to include unselfconscious transnationalism that   
 is more common and potentially more influential. Yao Lu is assistant  
 professor of sociology at Columbia University. Her research focuses   
 on how migration and immigration intersect with social, economic, and 
 political processes across diverse contexts. She is especially        
 interested in understanding the role of migration in social and       
 political change in migrant-sending areas. Information fom.barnard.edu

SUMMARY: Old Masters: Art Spiegelman, Jules Feiffer, Alex Melamid              

DESCRIPTION: Legendary artists and authors Jules Feiffer, Art Spiegelman, and Alex 
 Melamid will discuss the history and achievements of aging artists,   
 with a focus on artists whose best-known works were completed in the  
 later years of their lives. The discussion will use as its starting   
 point what renown critic Barbara Hernstein Smith called the senile    
 sublime. From Michelangelo, to Willem de Kooning, to Chester Gould,   
 all of whom lived into their 80s, these are artists whose later works 
 reflect a higher state of mental freedom. It is these late works that 
 have gained recognition at the turn of! the 21st Century.             
 The discussion will also turn to Feiffer, an Old Master who has       
 re-invented himself as an 85-year-old young graphic novelist, having  
 just published Kill My Mother to great acclaim. Normal 0 false false

DESCRIPTION: George Lewis A Recital for Terry Adkins (2014) Ensemble Pamplemousse  
 George Lewis, interactive media World Premiere A Recital for Terry    
 Adkins is a large-scale open-form ritual with live interaction        
 between instruments, electronic sounds, and digitized still and       
 moving images drawn from the work of Romare Bearden and Terry Adkins. 
 Program Participants George E. Lewis is the Edwin H. Case Professor   
 of American Music at Columbia University. A 2002 MacArthur Fellow and 
 a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians 
 (AACM) since 1971, Lewiss compositions are documented on more than    
 140 recordings, and have been presented by the BBC Scottish Symphony  
 Orchestra, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Talea Ensemble, Dinosaur  
 Annex, Ensemble Pamplemousse, Wet Ink, Ensemble Erik Satie, Eco       
 Ensemble, and others, with commissions from American Composers        
 Orchestra, International Contemporary Ensemble, Harvestworks,         
 Ensemble Either/Or, Orkestra Futura, Turning Point Ensemble, San      
 Francisco Contemporary Music Players, 2010 Vancouver Cultural

 Culture Award. Lewis and Benjamin Piekut are co-editors of the        
 forthcoming two-volume Oxford Handbook of Critical Improvisation      
 Studies. Composer/performer collective Ensemble Pamplemousse was      
 founded in 2003 to provide a focal point for like-minded creators     
 with a thirst for sonic exploration. The ensemble is a close-knit     
 group of divergent artistic personalities, emergent from training in  
 disparate musical fields. Their collective love for the exquisite in  
 all sonic realms leads the ensemble to persistently discover new      
 vistas of sound at the frayed edges of dissective instrumental        
 performance technique. Compositions aggregate each members unique     
 virtuosic talents into extraordinary magical moments. In the flexible 
 moments of performance, the ensemble weaves together shapes of        
 resonance, clusters of glitch, skitters of hyper action, and masses   
 of absurdity into impeccable structures of unified beauty. For more

SUMMARY: Public Humanities Initiative The Justice Forum: Paradigms             
 for Justice: Beyond Punishment                                        

DESCRIPTION: There is a growing consensus across the country about the devastating 
 consequences of mass incarceration and criminal justice policy.       
 Increasingly, scholars, clinicians, educators, politicians and        
 activists are examining the ways in which punishment is used in many  
 facets of our society including schools, courts, jails and prisons.   
 Many have found that the use of punishment as the core                
 of the criminal justice system is more damaging tha! n useful. There  
 is also a focus on the disproportionate use of punitive polices and   
 practices in Black communities and low-income communities of color.   
 This punishment paradigm needs to be replaced and people are          
 exploring alternative approaches to harm done, discipline             
 and conflict. This roundtable will bring together scholars,           
 educators, clinicians, activists and community members to critically  
 examine the utility of punishment in our society and discuss          
 alternative approaches to justice, accountability and                 
 safety. Speakers will discuss alternative frameworks and responses    
 including restorative justice theory and practice in different        
 contexts a public health approach to analyzing the causes             
 and consequences of behavior that is currently criminalized,          
 decarceration, and finally, the theory and work of prison             
 abolitionists. Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE /*

SUMMARY: From Chios to 125th Street: Toward a Black Odysseus                   

DESCRIPTION: By painting a black Odyssey, Romare Bearden connected the desire of   
 African American people to return home with Homers epic. In Beardens  
 art, the Odyssey is linked to the Freedom Riders, the Underground     
 Railroad, Marcus Garveys steamship line, and Rosa Parks on a Mobile   
 bus. Regardless of whether or not they knew Bearden, filmmakers have  
 also united Homer and American blacks. In John Sayles The Brother     
 from Another Planet (1984), an alien played by the African American   
 actor Joe Morton lands in Harlem and spends the rest of the film      
 trying to return to his home planet. Joel and Ethan Coens O Brother,  
 Where Art Thou? (2000), directly based on the Odyssey, has key black  
 characters, one of whom resembles Homer himself. There are also       
 Homeric references in the Coens Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), including 
 a black cat named Ulysses. To ground a black Odyssey within larger    
 cinematic traditions, we will also watch scenes from Godards Le mpris 
 (Contempt) (1963), in which a director seeks to make a film of the    
 Odyssey, Joseph Stricks Ulysses (1967), based on James Joyces novel,  
 and of course, 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).Program ParticipantKrin    
 Gabbard is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Cultural  
 Studies at Stony Brook University.nbsp Since 1971, he has taught      
 courses in cinema studies, the cultures of jazz, and the history of   
 literature.nbsp He is the author of Hotter than That The Trumpet,     
 Jazz, and American Culture (Farrar, Straus amp Giroux, 2009), Black   
 Magic White Hollywood and African American Culture (Rutgers U Press,  
 2004), Jammin at the Margins Jazz and the American Cinema (U of       
 Chicago Press, 1996) and Psychiatry and the Cinema (2nd ed.,          
 1999).nbsp He is currently writing an interpretive biography of jazz  
 artist Charles Mingus. Online registration is required.

SUMMARY: Composer Portraits: Keeril Makan                                      

DESCRIPTION: An arrestingly gifted young American composer (The New Yorker),       
 Keeril Makan is an artist who delves deep, engaging with and          
 reflecting human struggles and emotions in his work. His early        
 compositions explored the violence of the war in Afghanistan as well  
 as his own personal struggle with depression. In more recent works,   
 Makan has embraced stillness, celebrating sound in and of itself, and 
 demonstrating an elegant control of timbre and color.

DESCRIPTION: Join us for a talk that explores Barnards multifaceted relationship   
 to the city it calls home. Panelists consider a variety of topics,    
 from real-estate history and how Barnard became a campus, to student  
 activism in the progressive era, and how Barnard became a cultural    
 presence and a patron of the arts. Whether were tracing how Barnards  
 onetime remoteness in the former fortress of Morningside Heights gave 
 way to its influence on its changing and developing neighborhood, or  
 the unionization drive of the 1980s and the Colleges subsequent       
 reputation as an employer, youll gain a rare and nuanced perspective  
 on the countrys most sought-after womens college. Information
