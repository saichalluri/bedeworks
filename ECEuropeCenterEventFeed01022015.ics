SUMMARY: 'The Turks Were Killing the Body, the Austrians Kill the Soul':       
 Suffering as a Patriotic Sentiment in Bosnia, 1840-1914               

DESCRIPTION: Please join the Harriman Institute and East Central European Center   
 for a discussion aboutnbsp Suffering as a Patriotic Sentiment in      
 Bosnia between 1840-1914 with Edin Hajdarpasic, Assistant Professor   
 of History at Loyola University Chicago. In the wake of Romanticism,  
 early nationalist projects proclaimed a new age of happiness of the   
 folk, yet by the middle of the nineteenth century, national activists 
 across Europe were busily chronicling the agonizing pain of their     
 miserable homelands.nbsp Instead of dismissing suffering as a mere    
 rhetorical convention, this talk argues that the monumental body of   
 literature on this national suffering carried immense political       
 significance, underpinning the constitution and mobilization of South 
 Slavic nationalist sentiments throughout the nineteenth century.

SUMMARY: Media, Business, and Politics in Eastern Europe: Public Relations     
 Development and its Power                                             

DESCRIPTION: Please join us for an engaging Round table discussion Media, Business 
 and Politics in Eastern Europe Public Relations Development and its   
 Power. Three of the leading academics and business representatives    
 will discuss the transformation of Public Relations industry in       
 Eastern Europe, its overlap with politics and influence on those in   
 power. Central and Eastern European countries witnessed complete      
 restructuring of business, media and politics throughout the 1990s.   
 Free press emerged and public relations have turned into a            
 multimillion dollar business. Despite new ways of communications and  
 legislative progress, journalists are still experiencing threats to   
 their independency from (self)censorship, local media oligarchs and   
 powerful politicians. Media, business and politics thus overlap in    
 the region, with fascinating specifics in each country. Denisa        
 Hejlova and Anastasiia Grynko are leading scholars focusing on Public 
 Relations development and power in politics. They recently            
 co-authored a book titled Eastern European Perspectives on the        
 Development of Public Relations, the first reflection on the recent   
 history of PR in the region. Milan Hejl is Co-Founder and Director    
 AMI Communications, the biggest Non-Russian PR agency in Central and  
 Eastern Europe. Filip Tucek, President of the Columbia University     
 Central and Eastern European Club, will moderate the discussion. This 
 event is sponsored by the East Central European Center and Columbia   
 University Central and Eastern European (CUCEE) Club. Normal 0 false
