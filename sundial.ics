SUMMARY: Heyman Center Workshops On Method: Introducing Paper Machines         
DESCRIPTION: How do you summarize millions of books with a single tool? The        
 question is relevant to literary scholars, but especially to          
 historians of political institutions and the official mind. Paper     
 Machines is a toolkit that works with minimal code on the texts that  
 historians and other scholars are already using, visualizing them as  
 their subjects change over time and space. This talk will foreground  
 the role of big data, visualizations, and historians as the designers 
 of tools in the future shape of training in history departments,      
 topics taken up in Guldi and David Armitages new book, The History    
 Manifesto (October 2014, Cambridge University Press). For more        
 information, see the Paper Machines website and follow the project on 
 Twitter@papermachines, or visit the website of Jo Guldi and follow    
 her on Twitter@joguldi. The On Method Heyman Center workshop series   
 will examine the range of methods, theoretical and practical, used by 
 humanities scholars and critics, past and present. What are the       
 overarching techniques (techn)--what John Unsworth calls our          
 scholarly primitives--and epistemologies (epist#275m#275),            
 or theoretical apparati, inherent to humanities research? How are the 
 technological challenges and opportunities provided by new research   
 methods (computational, quantitative), organizational structures      
 (labs, workshops, co-working) tethered to epistemological shifts as   
 well? Following Thomas Kuhn, can we outline paradigms of humanistic   
 inquiry? Does it make sense to define method in the context of the    
 humanities, and if so, what are the varieties that method has taken   
 on? What are the national speicificities of these methods, and        
 of descriptions of the humanities itself? While much time has been    
 spent theorizing the digital in Digital Humanities, the workshop      
 seeks to gain a greater understanding of the heritage and future of   
 humanities methods in general, while contextualizing more precisely   
 the contributions of computational approaches in the process. Event   
 is free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served.

SUMMARY: Silent Moon: On Leopardi's "Canto Notturno"                           
DESCRIPTION: The great Romantic poet Giacomo Leopardis finest work was Night Song  
 of a Wandering Shepherd in Asia. Join us as two experts offer a       
 reading and discussion. As Helen Vendler says, Leopardis poetry is    
 charged on the one hand with a helpless longing, both sexual and      
 philosophical, and on the other hand by a bitterness that was both    
 personal and political. Jonathan Galassi (the president and publisher 
 of Farrar, Straus and Giroux) is the acclaimed translator of the 2012 
 English edition of Leopardis poems. He has also translated the poetry 
 and prose of Eugenio Montale and is the author of two volumes of      
 poems, Morning Run and North Street. Giorgio Ficara is teaching       
 a weekly graduate course in Columbias Italian Department he is the    
 third annual Compagnia di San Paolo / Italian Academy Distinguished   
 Visiting Professor. He is Professor of Italian Literature at the      
 University of Turin and has been a Visiting Professor at Stanford     
 University and UCLA. He has taught at the Sorbonne and the Collge de  
 France, Paris. Among his books are Solitudini. Studi sulla            
 letteratura italiana dal Duecento al Novecento (Garzanti, 1993        
  Premio Lerici 1994), Il punto di vista della Natura. Saggio su       
 Leopardi (Il Melangolo, 1996  runner-up Premio Viareggio 1997)        
 Casanova e la malinconia (Einaudi, 1999) and Stile Novecento          
 (Marsilio, 2007). In 1984 he won the Borgia Prize, Accademia          
 Nazionale dei Lincei. He is co-Editor of Lettere italiane and is a    
 regular contributor to La Stampa. The Compagnia di San Paolo /        
 Italian Academy Distinguished Visiting Professorship This series      
 focuses on Italian literature, art history, and musicology and        
 is made possible by multi-year funding from the Compagnia di San      
 Paolo. The Compagnia di San Paolo is working closely with the Italian 
 Academy to bring to Columbia a series of renowned scholars to promote 
 the knowledge of those areas of Italian learning which have           
 contributed so greatly to the development of culture. Founded in      
 1563, the Compagnia di San Paolo is a private, non-governmental       
 organization that generously and consistently supports education art  
 and the preservation and development of cultural heritage             
 and activities scientific, economic and juridical research health and 
 assistance to the socially deprived. Columbia University has already  
 benefited from the Compagnias international vision the School of      
 Journalism has a chair for the San Paolo Professor of International   
 Journalism as a result of an agreement developed in the 1990s by the  
 founding director of the Italian Academy. Given its international     
 scope and its long-standing commitment to all aspects of Italian      
 culture and society, Columbias Italian Academy has since its birth    
 maintained a dialogue with the Compagnia di San Paolo regarding the   
 maintenance of academic excellence at home and abroad. This new       
 Distinguished Visiting Professorship agreement confirms the           
 foundations commitment to Columbia as its American partner in the     
 promulgation of research and teaching done at the highest level. The  
 Italian Academy welcomes this opportunity to bring eminent Italian    
 scholars to the Columbia campus to interact with the promising        
 researchers who make up the core of the Academys fellowship program,  
 andin the larger communityto lecture and teach to a broader audience  
 of students and fellow scholars across the University. Normal 0 false

SUMMARY: A Roundtable on The History Manifesto: The Role of History and the    
 Humanities in a Digital Age                                           
DESCRIPTION: How should historians speak truth to power - and why does it matter?  
 Why is five hundred years better than five months or five years as a  
 planning horizon? And why is history -- especially long-term history  
 -- so essential to understanding the multiple pasts which gave rise   
 to our conflicted present? The History Manifesto is a call to arms to 
 historians and everyone interested in the role of history in          
 contemporary society. Leading historians David Armitage and Jo Guldi  
 identify a recent shift back to longer-term narratives, following     
 many decades of increasing specialization, which they argue is vital  
 for the future of historical scholarship and how it is communicated.  
 This provocative and thoughtful book makes an important intervention  
 in the debate about the role of history and the humanities in a       
 digital age. It will provoke discussion among policymakers, activists 
 and entrepreneurs as well as ordinary listeners, viewers, readers,    
 students and teachers. Armitage and Guldi will be in conversation     
 with Matthew L. Jones, James R. Barker Associate Professor            
 of Contemporary Civilization at Columbia University Dan Edelstein,    
 Professor of French and History at Stanford University and Mark       
 Mazower, Director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities. Event is

SUMMARY: Media, Business, and Politics in Eastern Europe: Public Relations     
 Development and its Power                                             
DESCRIPTION: Please join us for an engaging Round table discussion Media, Business 
 and Politics in Eastern Europe Public Relations Development and its   
 Power. Three of the leading academics and business representatives    
 will discuss the transformation of Public Relations industry in       
 Eastern Europe, its overlap with politics and influence on those in   
 power. Central and Eastern European countries witnessed complete      
 restructuring of business, media and politics throughout the 1990s.   
 Free press emerged and public relations have turned into a            
 multimillion dollar business. Despite new ways of communications and  
 legislative progress, journalists are still experiencing threats to   
 their independency from (self)censorship, local media oligarchs and   
 powerful politicians. Media, business and politics thus overlap in    
 the region, with fascinating specifics in each country. Denisa        
 Hejlova and Anastasiia Grynko are leading scholars focusing on Public 
 Relations development and power in politics. They recently            
 co-authored a book titled Eastern European Perspectives on the        
 Development of Public Relations, the first reflection on the recent   
 history of PR in the region. Milan Hejl is Co-Founder and Director    
 AMI Communications, the biggest Non-Russian PR agency in Central and  
 Eastern Europe. Filip Tucek, President of the Columbia University     
 Central and Eastern European Club, will moderate the discussion. This 
 event is sponsored by the East Central European Center and Columbia

SUMMARY: Statelessness in the United States: A Panel Discussion                
DESCRIPTION: Join a panel of stateless people and experts for a discussion on the  
 largely unknown challenge of statelessness in the United States.      
 Thousands of people are stateless in this country. But because the    
 United States does not recognize statelessness under its immigration  
 law, many people are subject to arbitrary detainment and in some      
 cases are never able to legalize their status or even gain travel     
 documents to leave the country. Refreshments will be served.Sponsored

DESCRIPTION: Mojubaolu Olufunke Okome examines womens strategies of empowerment,   
 both spiritual and material, in the Aldur church in the Nigerian      
 homeland and #8232its immigrant communities in #8232the United        
 States, especially since the 1980s. Scholars agree that womens roles  
 in these churches are circumscribed by prohibitions against           
 menstruation and women in the immediate postpartum period. Yet Okome  
 shows how, despite these formal restraints, Aldur women find ways to  
 exercise significant power in practice and why this is more           
 pronounced in Nigeria than in the U.S. immigrant churches. Okome is   
 professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the editor of  
 the scholarly journals Africa Migration and Jenda Journal.

SUMMARY: Angela Davis, Gwendolyn Wright, and Amale Andraos in conversation     
DESCRIPTION: Priority seating for Columbia-affiliated students with ID. It has     
 become so much a part of our lives that it requires a great feat of   
 the imagination to envision life beyond the prison, wrote Angela      
 Davis in her call for prison abolition, Are Prisons Obsolete? In this 
 conversation, the iconic activist and scholar is joined by Dean Amale 
 Andraos and Gwendolyn Wright to discuss the physical structures of    
 incarceration, and the myriad connections between militarized         
 policing of everyday life in the USdisproportionately affecting       
 low-income African Americans, women, and trans populationsand         
 Occupied Palestine today. How has punishment in the US changed since  
 the rise of the prison-industrial complex, which includes private and 
 public prisons, juvenile facilities, military prisons, and            
 interrogation centers? How has it changed since 9/11? Since Ferguson? 
 How have borders in the US and Occupied Palestine been militarized    
 and fortified, and who builds, maintains, and profits from this       
 system? Finally, how can designers and planners address the many      
 inequities of the prison system, and move from conversations of       
 reform to the imagination of something new? Normal 0 false false

 Gance, 1919, restored and reissued 2008, 166 min.Introduced by        
 Professor Antoine Compagnon This French silent film released in 1919  
 by director Abel Gance juxtaposes a romantic drama against the        
 backdrop of the horrors of World War I, including some scenes filmed  
 on real battlefields, and a climactic final sequence of the return of 
 the dead. Gance referred to it asnbsp a human cry against             
 the bellicose din of armies. It is considered to be among the most    
 technically advanced films of the era and the first major pacifist    
 film, and confirmed Gances international reputation as one of most    
 important directors in Europe.nbsp This is the fourth film in a       
 series of films on World War I presented this fall by The Maison

SUMMARY: Bryonn Bain: Lyrics From Lockdown                                   
DESCRIPTION: One man. One mic. 40 characters. Two unbelieveable true stories of    
 wrongful imprisonment. This unbelievably true story begins when       
 Brooklyns own hip hop theater innovator and spoken word champion,     
 Bryonn Bain (60 Minutes, The Village Voice, BETs My Two Cents), is    
 wrongly imprisoned in NYC jails  while studying law at Harvard.       
 Weaving together the voices of over 40 characters into a one-man tour 
 de force, Lyrics From Lockdown, executive produced by Gina and Harry  
 Belafonte, is receiving extraordinary reviews around the world.       
 A groundbreaking multimedia production, this critically acclaimed     
 show uses a live band and video DJ, fusing hip hop, theater, spoken   
 word poetry, rhythm and blues, calypso and classical music, to tell a 
 provocative story exposing racial profiling and wrongful              
 incarceration in a nation imprisoning more people than any other in   
 the world. Written and performed by Bryonn Bain. Praise for Lyrics    
 From Lockdown Every moment on stage was filled with a thing of        
 beauty. --Anna Deavere Smith He has style and considerable talent,    
 and his lyrics  a stirring mix of lament and demand  pack a punch.

 from Lockdown This unbelievably true story begins when Brooklyns own  
 hip hop theater innovator and spoken word champion, Bryonn Bain (60   
 Minutes, The Village Voice, BETs My Two Cents), is wrongly imprisoned 
 in NYC jails  while studying law at Harvard. Weaving together the     
 voices of over 40 characters into a one-man tour de force, Lyrics     
 From Lockdown, executive produced by Gina and Harry Belafonte,        
 is receiving extraordinary reviews around the world. A groundbreaking 
 multimedia production, this critically acclaimed show uses a live     
 band and video DJ, fusing hip hop, theater, spoken word poetry,       
 rhythm and blues, calypso and classical music, to tell a provocative  
 story exposing racial profiling and wrongful incarceration in a       
 nation imprisoning more people than any other in the world. Lyrics

SUMMARY: Improvisation in the Arts: A Symposium                                
DESCRIPTION: Romare Bearden constantly made the color he constantly looked for.    
 His collages mirrored and enacted what critic Laura Harris calls the  
 aesthetics of black social life, moving against the brutalities of    
 removal and enclosure that structure global black experience and,     
 therefore, the modern world. A Black Odyssey refers, though, not only 
 to Afro-diasporic travel and travail but also to an anoriginary       
 movement of in the art of the West that blackness has                 
 come to signifythe polyrhythmic, oral-formulaic, insurgent innovation 
 that was also Homers home away from home.In this panel,               
 a multi-disciplinary group of artists and scholars will sit in with   
 Bearden, gathering with and around his Odyssean practice,             
 his restless, wandering devotion to the scrap, the fragment, the      
 musical moment, and his abiding in and with the imagination, whose    
 enduring philosophical racialization renders it both disposable and   
 appropriable. The intensity of Beardens commitment to the aesthetic   
 contact and content of black social life in its broadest dimensions   
 will serve as an impetus for a wide-ranging discussion                
 of the protocols and implications of improvisation in music,          
 literature, theology, cinema, dance and critical theory. Along with   
 Bearden and, most importantly, the audience, the panel hopes to form  
 a new experimental band. Program ParticipantsFred Moten is author of  
 In the Break The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition, Hughsons  
 Tavern, B. Jenkins, The Undercommons Fugitive Planning and Black      
 Study (with Stefano Harney), The Feel Trio and The Little Edges.      
 Moten lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the University of           
 California, Riverside. John Akomfrah OBE, is a seminal figure in      
 Black British Cinema and forerunner in digital cinematography. He has 
 a body of work that is considered one of the most distinctive and     
 innovative in contemporary Britain. Born in Ghana, to politically     
 active parents he moved to London at an early age. He was a founding  
 figure in the influential cine cultural group Black Audio Film        
 Collective which was dedicated to exploring questions of Black        
 British identity, race and class through film and media. In 1999, he  
 set up Smoking Dogs Films - which simultaneously cohabits the worlds  
 of broadcast, cinema and the arts - with his long term producing      
 partners, David Lawson and Lina Gopaul. John has served on numerous   
 boards as a governor, including the British Film Institute and Film   
 London and has taught at a number of institutions around the world    
 including MIT, Yale and the University of Westminster. John Akomfrah  
 is a director, writer and theorist who creates documentaries, feature 
 films and exhibitions that have garnered international critical       
 acclaim. J. Kameron Carternbsp is a professor and teaches courses in  
 both theology and black church studies. Working as a theologian, he   
 addresses the basic areas of Christian thought, especially attending  
 to Christology (the person and work of Jesus Christ) and theological  
 anthropology (the human being in Christian perspective). But in       
 engaging such matters, he does so with a view not just to the church  
 or to Christian believers. He does so with a view to the broader      
 humanities, particularly, with an eye toward such fields as cultural  
 studies, gender studies, and philosophy and literature. His book Race 
 A Theological Account (New York Oxford University Press, 2008) has    
 recently appeared. He is presently working on a new book on the       
 ideological uses of Jesus in the modern invention of the human, and   
 thus in the making and sustaining of the present. Addressing this in  
 its religious, secular, and now arguably post-secular forms,          
 Professor Carter calls this the problem of the cultural Jesus. The    
 project provides a theological, which at the same time is a cultural, 
 archaeology of the present by getting inside of this problem. But     
 beyond this, and having gotten inside of this problem, Professor      
 Carter reimagines the identity of Jesus and the politics of his       
 identity in light of the new, global realities of the 21st century.   
 Danielle Goldman In her research, she analyzes the social, cultural,  
 and historical conditions that affect how people move.                
 She is fascinated by critical theories of the body, andnbsp tendd to  
 think about dance as an arena for experimental relations between self 
 and other. These interests are informed by her experience as a dancer 
  taking class, rehearsing, and performing (most recently for the      
 choreographers DD Dorvillier and Beth Gill). Persistent shuttling     
 between dance practice and academic work  two worlds that she has     
 been trying to bridge for as long as she can remember  has shown her  
 that dance and critical theory inform each other in significant ways, 
 revealing much about embodiment, subjectivity, and notions            
 of identity. M. NourbeSe Philips is an unembedded poet, essayist,     
 novelist and playwright who lives in the space-time of the City of    
 Toronto. She practiced law in the City of Toronto for seven years     
 before becoming a poet and writer. She has published four books of    
 poetry including the seminal She Tries Her Tongue Her Silence Softly  
 Breaks, one novel and three collections of essays. Her most recent    
 work is the conceptually innovative, book-length poem Zong!, which    
 explodes the legal archive as it relates to slavery. Among her awards 
 are numerous Canada Council and Ontario Arts Council grants, as well  
 as the Pushcart Prize (USA, 1981), the Casa de las Americas Prize     
 (Cuba, 1988), the Lawrence Foundation Prize (USA, 1994), and the Arts 
 Foundation of Toronto Writing and Publishing Award                    
 (Toronto,1995),nbsp Dora Award finalist (1999). Her fellowships       
 include Guggenheim (1990), McDowell (1991), and Rockefeller           
 (Bellagio) (2005). She has been Writer-in-Residence at several        
 universities. Matana Robertsnbsp internationally documented and

 instrument is the alto saxophone and she works in many                
 performance/sound mediums including improvisation, dance, poetry, and 
 theater. She aims to expose the mystical roots and the intuitive      
 spirit-raising traditions of American creative expression in her      
 music. Her innovative work has forged new conceptual approaches to    
 considering narrative, history, and political expression within       
 improvisatory structures. Past member of the BRC Black Rock Coalition 
 and the AACM Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.   
 She holds two degrees in music performance. She is based in New York

SUMMARY: The Case Of China: How Migration Shapes Political Attitudes and       
 Participation in Origin Communities                                   
DESCRIPTION: This presentation examines the consequences of migration for          
 political transformation in origin communities in China. Lu broadens  
 previous scholarly focus on the transnational activism of politically 
 conscious migrants to include unselfconscious transnationalism that   
 is more common and potentially more influential. Yao Lu is assistant  
 professor of sociology at Columbia University. Her research focuses   
 on how migration and immigration intersect with social, economic, and 
 political processes across diverse contexts. She is especially        
 interested in understanding the role of migration in social and       
 political change in migrant-sending areas. Information fom.barnard.edu

SUMMARY: Old Masters: Art Spiegelman, Jules Feiffer, Alex Melamid              
DESCRIPTION: Legendary artists and authors Jules Feiffer, Art Spiegelman, and Alex 
 Melamid will discuss the history and achievements of aging artists,   
 with a focus on artists whose best-known works were completed in the  
 later years of their lives. The discussion will use as its starting   
 point what renown critic Barbara Hernstein Smith called the senile    
 sublime. From Michelangelo, to Willem de Kooning, to Chester Gould,   
 all of whom lived into their 80s, these are artists whose later works 
 reflect a higher state of mental freedom. It is these late works that 
 have gained recognition at the turn of! the 21st Century.             
 The discussion will also turn to Feiffer, an Old Master who has       
 re-invented himself as an 85-year-old young graphic novelist, having  
 just published Kill My Mother to great acclaim. Normal 0 false false

DESCRIPTION: George Lewis A Recital for Terry Adkins (2014) Ensemble Pamplemousse  
 George Lewis, interactive media World Premiere A Recital for Terry    
 Adkins is a large-scale open-form ritual with live interaction        
 between instruments, electronic sounds, and digitized still and       
 moving images drawn from the work of Romare Bearden and Terry Adkins. 
 Program Participants George E. Lewis is the Edwin H. Case Professor   
 of American Music at Columbia University. A 2002 MacArthur Fellow and 
 a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians 
 (AACM) since 1971, Lewiss compositions are documented on more than    
 140 recordings, and have been presented by the BBC Scottish Symphony  
 Orchestra, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Talea Ensemble, Dinosaur  
 Annex, Ensemble Pamplemousse, Wet Ink, Ensemble Erik Satie, Eco       
 Ensemble, and others, with commissions from American Composers        
 Orchestra, International Contemporary Ensemble, Harvestworks,         
 Ensemble Either/Or, Orkestra Futura, Turning Point Ensemble, San      
 Francisco Contemporary Music Players, 2010 Vancouver Cultural         
 Olympiad, IRCAM, Glasgow Improvisers Orchestra, and others. Most      
 recently, Lewis has served as Ernest Bloch Visiting Professor,        
 University of California, Berkeley Paul Fromm Composer in Residence,  
 American Academy in Rome and Resident Scholar, Center                 
 for Disciplinary Innovation, University of Chicago. Lewis received    
 the 2012 SEAMUS Award from the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in  
 the United States, and his widely acclaimed book, A Power Stronger    
 Than Itself The AACM and American Experimental Music (University of   
 Chicago Press, 2008) received the American Book Award

 Culture Award. Lewis and Benjamin Piekut are co-editors of the        
 forthcoming two-volume Oxford Handbook of Critical Improvisation      
 Studies. Composer/performer collective Ensemble Pamplemousse was      
 founded in 2003 to provide a focal point for like-minded creators     
 with a thirst for sonic exploration. The ensemble is a close-knit     
 group of divergent artistic personalities, emergent from training in  
 disparate musical fields. Their collective love for the exquisite in  
 all sonic realms leads the ensemble to persistently discover new      
 vistas of sound at the frayed edges of dissective instrumental        
 performance technique. Compositions aggregate each members unique     
 virtuosic talents into extraordinary magical moments. In the flexible 
 moments of performance, the ensemble weaves together shapes of        
 resonance, clusters of glitch, skitters of hyper action, and masses   
 of absurdity into impeccable structures of unified beauty. For more   
 information on this ensemble, please visit

SUMMARY: Public Humanities Initiative The Justice Forum: Paradigms             
 for Justice: Beyond Punishment                                        
DESCRIPTION: There is a growing consensus across the country about the devastating 
 consequences of mass incarceration and criminal justice policy.       
 Increasingly, scholars, clinicians, educators, politicians and        
 activists are examining the ways in which punishment is used in many  
 facets of our society including schools, courts, jails and prisons.   
 Many have found that the use of punishment as the core                
 of the criminal justice system is more damaging tha! n useful. There  
 is also a focus on the disproportionate use of punitive polices and   
 practices in Black communities and low-income communities of color.   
 This punishment paradigm needs to be replaced and people are          
 exploring alternative approaches to harm done, discipline             
 and conflict. This roundtable will bring together scholars,           
 educators, clinicians, activists and community members to critically  
 examine the utility of punishment in our society and discuss          
 alternative approaches to justice, accountability and                 
 safety. Speakers will discuss alternative frameworks and responses    
 including restorative justice theory and practice in different        
 contexts a public health approach to analyzing the causes             
 and consequences of behavior that is currently criminalized,          
 decarceration, and finally, the theory and work of prison             
 abolitionists. Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE /*

SUMMARY: From Chios to 125th Street: Toward a Black Odysseus                   
DESCRIPTION: By painting a black Odyssey, Romare Bearden connected the desire of   
 African American people to return home with Homers epic. In Beardens  
 art, the Odyssey is linked to the Freedom Riders, the Underground     
 Railroad, Marcus Garveys steamship line, and Rosa Parks on a Mobile   
 bus. Regardless of whether or not they knew Bearden, filmmakers have  
 also united Homer and American blacks. In John Sayles The Brother     
 from Another Planet (1984), an alien played by the African American   
 actor Joe Morton lands in Harlem and spends the rest of the film      
 trying to return to his home planet. Joel and Ethan Coens O Brother,  
 Where Art Thou? (2000), directly based on the Odyssey, has key black  
 characters, one of whom resembles Homer himself. There are also       
 Homeric references in the Coens Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), including 
 a black cat named Ulysses. To ground a black Odyssey within larger    
 cinematic traditions, we will also watch scenes from Godards Le mpris 
 (Contempt) (1963), in which a director seeks to make a film of the    
 Odyssey, Joseph Stricks Ulysses (1967), based on James Joyces novel,  
 and of course, 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).Program ParticipantKrin    
 Gabbard is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Cultural  
 Studies at Stony Brook University.nbsp Since 1971, he has taught      
 courses in cinema studies, the cultures of jazz, and the history of   
 literature.nbsp He is the author of Hotter than That The Trumpet,     
 Jazz, and American Culture (Farrar, Straus amp Giroux, 2009), Black   
 Magic White Hollywood and African American Culture (Rutgers U Press,  
 2004), Jammin at the Margins Jazz and the American Cinema (U of       
 Chicago Press, 1996) and Psychiatry and the Cinema (2nd ed.,          
 1999).nbsp He is currently writing an interpretive biography of jazz  
 artist Charles Mingus. Online registration is required.

SUMMARY: Composer Portraits: Keeril Makan                                      
DESCRIPTION: An arrestingly gifted young American composer (The New Yorker),       
 Keeril Makan is an artist who delves deep, engaging with and          
 reflecting human struggles and emotions in his work. His early        
 compositions explored the violence of the war in Afghanistan as well  
 as his own personal struggle with depression. In more recent works,   
 Makan has embraced stillness, celebrating sound in and of itself, and 
 demonstrating an elegant control of timbre and color.

DESCRIPTION: Join us for a talk that explores Barnards multifaceted relationship   
 to the city it calls home. Panelists consider a variety of topics,

 activism in the progressive era, and how Barnard became a cultural    
 presence and a patron of the arts. Whether were tracing how Barnards  
 onetime remoteness in the former fortress of Morningside Heights gave 
 way to its influence on its changing and developing neighborhood, or  
 the unionization drive of the 1980s and the Colleges subsequent       
 reputation as an employer, youll gain a rare and nuanced perspective  
 on the countrys most sought-after womens college. Information
