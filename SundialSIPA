SUMMARY: Georgia and its World Bank Ease of Business Rankings                  
DESCRIPTION: Please join us for a talk bynbspDr. Samuel Schuethnbspon his work on  
 increasing Georgias ranking on the World Banks Business Index.nbspDr. 
 Samuel Schuethnbspis a professional social scientist based at the     
 University of Minnesota whonbspleads the design, implementation, and  
 analysis of quantitative and qualitative research on international    
 development projects and programs. He has                             
 implementednbspmixed-methods research to evaluate the impact of       
 stability and governance initiatives, measure economic growth, and    
 construct and deconstruct indices of good governance, business        
 confidence and competitiveness innbspEthiopia, Somalia, Jordan,       
 Georgia (Caucasus Republic), and Afghanistan. He is an expert in the  
 design of indicators and indices for measuring governance quality and 
 economic development. In Georgia he evaluated a USAID project that    
 worked with the revolutionary government of Mikhail Saakashvili to    
 dramatically increase the countrys ranking on the World Banks Doing   
 Business Index. This rankings ascension was used to recast the        
 country as an emerging market instead of a post-Soviet failed state.  
 Since completing this work in Georgia, Dr. Schueth has engaged in the 
 evaluation, construction, and interpretation of global rankings and   
 ratings in a variety of contexts and through different international  
 development initiatives and publications.
