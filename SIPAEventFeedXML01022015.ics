SUMMARY: Origins of Environmental Law Lecture Series: Congress Today: The Role 
 of Campaign Finance on Environmental Legislation                      

DESCRIPTION: The Earth Institute presents Origins of Environmental Law Lecture     
 Series Description Introduction to Early Environmental Legislation,   
 Pre-1969. nbsp This seminar is part of a semester-long lecture series 
 entitled The Origins of Environmental Law Regulation and Evolution.   
 Leon G. Billings and Thomas C. Jorling are the two senior staff       
 members who led the Senate environment subcommittee which originated  
 and developed major environmental legislation in the 1970s, including 
 the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Superfund Act. Over   
 the course of a single decade, Congress enacted a series of           
 environmental laws that defined the direction and character of        
 environmental policy in the US and globally. Learn about the process  
 that led to these seminal laws from the writers of the legislation    
 themselves.In their final talk in this seminar series, Billings and   
 Jorling will discuss the nature of Congress today, and look at why    
 the federal government has not taken substantial action on            
 environmental law for the past several decades. They will look at the 
 evolution of campaign finance laws, and will consider how campaign    
 finance and fundraising impact policy and legislation. nbspnbsp RSVP  
 is required for this event. Please note this lecture is part of       
 a regularly scheduled course. Guests will join registered students in 
 the class for the lecture and discussion. For more information about

SUMMARY: Central Asia in Asia: Emerging Links, Rivalries, and Opportunities    

DESCRIPTION: Prevailing narratives describing Central Asian international politics 
 tend to refer to a looming power struggle along an EastWest divide.   
 Today, however, we see accelerating trans-regional integration across 
 diverse Asian sub-regions (East, West, North, South, and Central),    
 much of it bypassing the West altogether.nbspChina,nbspIndia, Iran,   
 Israel, Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, Turkey, all have adopted        
 Central Asia or Silk Road policies of one kind or another and have    
 developed an increasingly noticeable political, economic and security 
 footprint. Southeast Asian countries are equally reaching out to      
 Central Asia both bilaterally and through ASEAN. Moreover, these new  
 forms of pan-Asian integration have also acquired a multilateral      
 dimension, underscored by the rise of the China-led Shanghai          
 Cooperation Organization, the Japan plus Central Asia Dialogue, and   
 the Conference for Interaction and Cooperation in Asia.nbspWhat will  
 be thenbspramifications ofnbspgreater pan-Asian interconnectedness?   
 How might these developments affect not only the foreign policy       
 priorities of the Central Asian states, but broader issues like the   
 rapidly shifting international order and the global balance of power? 
 Focusing on Central Asias growing ties with China, Japan, South Korea 
 and South East Asian countries, this panel of acclaimed international 
 scholars will examine these evolving Central-Asia/Asia Pacific        
 relations in thepolitical, security, and economic realms.PART I

SUMMARY: Sustainable Development Seminar Series: Impacts of Agricultural       
 Practices on Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Health                

DESCRIPTION: The Earth Institute presents the second of the 2014-2015 Sustainable  
 Development Seminar Series, Impacts of Agricultural Practices on      
 Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Health, with Susanne Bauer,        
 Research Scientist, Center for Climate Systems Research, NASA Goddard 
 Institute for Space Studies (GISS), The Earth Institute, Columbia     
 University, Patrick Kinney, Professor, Environmental Health Sciences, 
 Director, Columbia Climate and Health Program, Mailman School of      
 Public Health, Columbia University and Alexander Ruane, Adjunct       
 Associate Research Scientist, Center for Climate Systems Research,    
 NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), The Earth Institute, 
 Columbia University.nbsp Agriculture and Climate are interrelated on  
 multiple levels. Leading up to research questions that are studied at 
 many Departments across Columbia University. Climate has significant  
 impacts on conditions affecting agriculture, including temperature,   
 carbon dioxide, and the hydrological cycle. Conditions that determine 
 world food production, food security and public health. A topic that  
 achieves much less attention is the fact that, agriculture has been   
 shown to produce significant effects on climate change, primarily     
 through the production of greenhouse gases, altering Earths land      
 cover, and by releasing precursors of air pollutants. The use of      
 industrial fertilizers, a crucial component of agriculture in the     
 industrial world, and an important tool for the Developing world, has 
 shown to be an significant contributor to air pollution. It appears   
 it is important to enlighten not only the impact of climate on        
 agriculture, but also the impact of agriculture on climate, which     
 until recently, has been little discussed in climate policy, much     
 less a focus of or major participant in policy negotiations.In this   
 seminar we will discuss the impact of agriculture on atmospheric      
 chemistry, the effect of air pollution on public health, and the      
 impact of climate on food production.Open to the public.              
 RSVP required. Photo ID required for building access.For

SUMMARY: Markets, Labor, and Regulation                                        

DESCRIPTION: Are markets in developing and transition economies over-regulated or  
 under-regulated? This is a perennial question in the development      
 discourse, but one for which answers appear to come more from preset  
 ideology rather than from context specific analysis and evidence.     
 This conference seeks to explore the frontiers of policy analysis and 
 research on Markets, Labor and Regulation. It will (i) consider       
 regulation of output markets and markets for capital as well as the   
 market for labor, (ii) pay particular attention to the enforcement of 
 regulations, (iii) explore the links between regulation, deregulation 
 and inequality, (iv) highlight the political economy of regulation,   
 and (v) bring in international dimensions of regulation. Co-Sponsored

SUMMARY: Georgia and its World Bank Ease of Business Rankings                  

DESCRIPTION: Please join us for a talk bynbspDr. Samuel Schuethnbspon his work on  
 increasing Georgias ranking on the World Banks Business Index.nbspDr. 
 Samuel Schuethnbspis a professional social scientist based at the     
 University of Minnesota whonbspleads the design, implementation, and  
 analysis of quantitative and qualitative research on international    
 development projects and programs. He has                             
 implementednbspmixed-methods research to evaluate the impact of       
 stability and governance initiatives, measure economic growth, and    
 construct and deconstruct indices of good governance, business        
 confidence and competitiveness innbspEthiopia, Somalia, Jordan,       
 Georgia (Caucasus Republic), and Afghanistan. He is an expert in the  
 design of indicators and indices for measuring governance quality and 
 economic development. In Georgia he evaluated a USAID project that    
 worked with the revolutionary government of Mikhail Saakashvili to    
 dramatically increase the countrys ranking on the World Banks Doing   
 Business Index. This rankings ascension was used to recast the        
 country as an emerging market instead of a post-Soviet failed state.  
 Since completing this work in Georgia, Dr. Schueth has engaged in the 
 evaluation, construction, and interpretation of global rankings and   
 ratings in a variety of contexts and through different international  
 development initiatives and publications.
