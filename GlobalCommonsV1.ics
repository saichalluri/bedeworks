SUMMARY: Consulta Previa: The Perils and Promise Of                            
DESCRIPTION: In the past decade, a little known international convention, ILO 169, 
 has become a flash point for social conflict in the region, pitting   
 communities against investors in natural resource extraction and      
 infrastructureand leaving governments struggling to define and        
 implement the provisions locally. The ILO provision establishes the   
 right of indigenous communities to be consulted on any policy that is 
 determined to affect their culture, a right interpreted to include    
 collective land ownership. Since its approval, Colombia (1991), Peru  
 (1995), Guatemala (1996), and Chile (2009) have ratified the treaty,  
 but have since struggled to develop the laws, regulations, and state  
 capacity to enforce ILO 169.
